In the smoke-filled haze of a thriving jazz club, Alice met her explosive end, leaving Detective Winston to sift through the suspects: Eugene, the shy pianist, and Gabrielle, the sassy club singer.

While seated at his desk at the precinct, Winston received a phone call from a certain observant local bartender, tipping off the police about a harsh row peaking in a nearby jazz club. He signaled to his partner as they promptly dispatched to the scene, already ringing with sirens and a restless crowd. 

With the police line restraining the horde, the jazz club was undergoing a full round-up as Winston approached the informative bartender. The bartender was engrossed in his account to the officers about a raucous, punch throwing fight Eugene was part of, to his best recollection. Winston remembered Eugene, a jazz fanatic—lurking around the jazz corners more often than anyone else could recount.

In the heart of the upheaval, lay a woman sprawled on the floor, later identified as Alice, a frequent face at the jazz scene and a financial analyst deeply engrossed in financial transactions. In public, Alice had made her concerns known about her discovery of fraudulent transactions at the bank, promising to report the same to the authorities. Eugene, remembered conspicuously for being a bank teller at the same bank Alice worked at, suddenly seemed closely linked.

Eugene’s arrest was far from hushed, with the local news broadcasting the progressing drama live, catching sight of Eugene curtailed in handcuffs. Concurrently, it was ascertained—Eugene was a member of the jazz club. This evidence backed by a jazz club membership card retrieved from his wallet during the arrest.

Just a few steps away, he noticed a man in a suit, the bouncer, a calm figure amid the bedlam. In their conversation, the bouncer corroborated that he had indeed seen Eugene involved in a heated scuffle, landing a few punches. The whisperings were starting to gain momentum, since Eugene was believed to be on the losing end of a lawsuit—a battle courtesy of Alice charging Eugene with the financial fraud she had publicly vowed to expose.

Eugene was known for his frequent presence at the jazz club and on top of that, was an actual member. Therefore, it was hardly a leap to presume Alice meeting her untimely end at the club was no mere happenstance. The jazz club, despite its dim lights and pulsating music, was a public place easily accessible to all, including potential suspects like Eugene and, sadly, the ill-starred Alice.

Det. Winston knew he was now tasked with a cryptic puzzle. A bank teller, embroiled in suspected fraud and a lawsuit, a jazz club murder scene and a local financial analyst—all woven into a ghastly murder mystery. He sighed in distaste as Eugene was escorted away—a man still oblivious to the chain of events waiting for him. But Winston knew, the night had only just begun for him.

Winston stared down at the crumpled microphone on the floor. He picked it up gingerly, turning it in his hand. The club was in disarray, debris scattered like confetti. The lab boys were still picking pieces of the grenade apart.

"Gabrielle's microphone," the coroner confirmed, barely looking up from his task.

"Give him the once-over for evidence," Winston said, handing the microphone to a nearby officer.

Leaving the club behind him, Winston sighed heavily. The world of jazz had taken a dark turn that night. Alice, the acclaimed critic with her sarcastic wit and keen critical eye, had been last seen alive here. Her purse lay in the club untouched, a testament to the abruptness of the event.

Gabrielle had been working as a war correspondent. Winston had read her articles. They were richly detailed, passionate, and highlighted the harsh reality of war zones. Gabrielle hadn't been shy about sharing her experiences or publicly criticizing the military in her pieces. She boldly interviewed military personnel and spent extended periods in conflict zones.

Alice, though, never missed a chance to pick apart Gabrielle's articles. The vitriolic snippets in Alice’s column were regular features and Gabrielle's staunch defense of her articles, her work in the jazz scene, did little against Alice's respected reputation.

The tension between them was palpable. Alice had been awarded a major journalist award that Gabrielle had desired. This only deepened their rivalry, with Gabrielle feeling overlooked for this recognition in the Jazz scene.

Winston cast his gaze over the club once more—a hub of pulsating rhythms now eerily silent.

A significant part of the evening was Gabrielle's recorded interview with Alice. It played on the local radio, their professional rivalry subtly echoing under their professional demeanor.

With a deep breath, Winston knew he had a tall task ahead. The jazz club, where Alice was last seen alive was now shrouded in an eerie silence, the vibrant rhythms of what used to be a lively night echoing in the abandoned stage. It was up to him to piece together the missing notes and bring the symphony of this unsolved case to a satisfying finale.

Who is the most likely murderer?

Pick one of the following choices:
1 - Eugene
2 - Gabrielle

You must pick one option. Before selecting a choice, explain your reasoning step by step. The murderer needs to have a means (access to weapon), motive (reason to kill the victim), and opportunity (access to crime scene) in order to have killed the victim. Innocent suspects may have two of these proven, but not all three. An innocent suspect may be suspicious for some other reason, but they will not have all of motive, means, and opportunity established.

If you believe that both suspects have motive, means, and opportunity, you should make an educated guess pick the one for whom these are best established. If you believe that neither suspect has all three established, then choose the suspect where these are most clearly established. Explain your reasoning step by step before you answer. Finally, the last thing you generate should be "ANSWER: (your answer here, including the choice number)"

Let's break this down step-by-step by first deducing which of the two suspects has a means, motive, and opportunity.

We will start with Eugene.

Eugene was being sued by Alice for fraudulent transactions.  The charge was also very public.  Both of these facts point to Eugene having a strong motive.

Because Eugene has a jazz club membership, and we can deduce that the jazz club membership belongs to the same club Alice was murdered in, we can assume Eugene has an opportunity to commit the crime.

Although we know Eugene is aggressive because he was throwing punches in the story, we do not know if he has access to the murder weapon.  Because he does not have access to a grenade, he does not have a means.

Let's review Gabrielle next.

Gabrielle's purse was found at the scene of the crime, and we can then assume she had the opportunity to kill Alice.

Because Gabrielle has been in conflict zones with military personnel, it's possible that she has access to a grenade.  We can say that Gabrielle has a potential means to kill the victim.

Finally, it appears that Gabrielle and Alice had a rivalry over journalism, which could have boiled up into physical action.  Because of this, we can say that Gabrielle has a potential motive to kill the victim.

Now, reviewing the evidence, we see that:

Eugene has a motive and opportunity but no means.
Gabrielle has a motive, means, and opportunity.

Therefore, Gabrielle is the most likely murderer.
