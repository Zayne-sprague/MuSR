## MuSR Eval

The datasets are in `datasets/{domain_name}.json`

### Install

1. `virtualenv venv` we have tested with python 3.8
2. `source venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Evaluate


To run the evaluation script on the MuSR datasets:
```shell
cd musr_eval
OPENAI_API_KEY=key python eval.py
```

You can edit the functionality of the evaluation in eval.py as well (including different prompting strategies, models, and more).

### [Optional] Install Redis for caching  

We cache all LLM calls (openai and huggingface) with keys based on the prompt and model parameters to speed up evaluations.

To do this, we used [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/clients/python/)

Easiest way to install it is (for linux)
1. `apt-get install redis`
2. `redis-server`

Alternatively you can run our code without redis or disable the cache entirely by commenting out the lines `cache.enable()`.

### New models

Right now we support all the OpenAI endpoints and models published on Huggingface.  

Custom models made in PyTorch or Tensorflow will need to have an implementation that follows from the `Model` class in `src/model/model.py` similar to `src/model/hf.py` (for Huggingface).  

### New prompts and MuSR domain datasets

These are easily added to the `eval/eval.py` file.


## Overview of MuSR

<image src="./imgs/system_diagram.png"></image>


This repository holds the code for the paper _MuSR: Testing the Limits of Chain-of-thought with Multistep Soft Reasoning_

All MuSR datasets can be found in `{project_root}/datasets`. Follow the installation guide to get the datasets mentioned from the paper downloaded.

Major components for making the MuSR dataset can be found in `{project_root}/src`.  

Important classes and structures will have some example uses in their files (Madlib and LogicTree for example)

The scripts used to create a dataset can be found in `{project_root}/musr_dataset_scripts`

Evaluation scripts are in `{project_root}/eval`


## Generating a dataset

Every dataset creation script is in `{project_root}/musr_dataset_scripts`.  In those files are detailed instructions on how to create MuSR datasets as well as parameters for creating your own unique datasets!  Individual components that are used to create each dataset should be heavily documented as well.

To run a script:

```shell
cd musr_dataset_scripts
OPENAI_API_KEY=key python {dataset_script}.py
```
NOTE: We tested most of this with GPT-4.  It's possible that quality may significantly degrade if you use a different model due to the prompts being heavily tailored to GPT-4 as well as expecting the LLM to produce "good" outputs (some datasets require parsing of an output which requires strict formatting)

This will produce a dataset file in `{project_root}/datasets` after it completes.

## Creating your own dataset

You can implement your own DatasetBuilder following the examples for the other domains.

For example, the important files used in creating murder mysteries are:

`{project_root}/src/dataset_builder.py`: The main file used for creating all datasets (shared functionality including the recursive reasoning tree expansion algorithm).

`{project_root}/src/dataset_types/murder_mystery_dataset.py`: Specific domain logic (and some prompts) for creating the murder mysteries.

`{project_root}/musr_dataset_scripts/create_murder_mysteries.py`: The main file that glues everything together (and includes some more prompts).
